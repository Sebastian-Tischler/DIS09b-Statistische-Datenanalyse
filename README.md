## General Info
This Statistical Data Analysis was created as part of the DIS09b Statistical Data Analysis module.
The Jupyter Notebook file uploaded here represents my submission for the module exam. I have myself
decided to do a data analysis of the "Word Happiness Report". I have explored the hypothesis that there is a correlation between social support and healthy life expectancy. If you are interested in the results of my analysis, then
have a look at the ipynb file and get an idea. :)


## My Task
Use a publicly available dataset
and run a statistical analysis with python
and the presented packages (pandas, seaborn, scipy) in a Jupyter notebook.
Describe your question / hypothesis in the Jupyter Notebook (in Markdown cells).
you want to answer / substantiate with the analysis and the data set with its background. the
Analysis should include at least two visualizations that help answer the questions (e.g. a
histogram) and at least one statistical test (e.g. a two-sample t-test).
The text can also be written in English.
Divide your Jupyter Notebook into headings (German or English):
- Background and question
- Description of the data set
- Visualization and analysis
- Interpretation of the results
